# FASTER
FASTER (Failure Analysis, Simulation, Testing, and Evaluation Report) automates reliability analysis for LTspice circuits. It performs FMEDA and FTA, simulating faults to assess impacts on circuit performance. The program generates detailed reports with plots of currents and voltages, providing insights to enhance circuit reliability and safety.
