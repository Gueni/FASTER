<<<<<<< HEAD
Programt that can take an LTspice file, analyze the circuit, and perform Failure Modes, Effects, and Diagnostic Analysis (FMEDA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). The program generates at the end a report with all plots of currents and voltages at every component.

## Todo
    
    - Montecarlo 
    - Part stress 
    - Worst case 
    - simulate
